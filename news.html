The server is owned by Eitan Fitusi, co-founder of AI.type. The database appears to only contain records on the app's Android users.  Each record contains a basic collected data, including the user's full name, email addresses, and how many days the app was installed. Each record also included a user's precise location, including their city and country. More complete records also include the device's IMSI and IMEI number, the device's make and model, its screen resolution, and the device's specific Android version. A large portion of the records also included the user's phone number and the name of their cell phone provider, and in some cases their IP address and name of their internet provider if connected to Wi-Fi. Many records contain specific details of a user's public Google profile, including email addresses, dates of birth, genders, and profile photos. We also found several tables of contact data uploaded from a user's phone. One table listed 10.7 million email addresses, while another contained 374.6 million phone numbers.

"Intel published a security advisory last night detailing eight vulnerabilities that impact core CPU technologies such as the Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).
The vulnerabilities are severe enough to allow attackers to install rootkits on vulnerable PCs, retrieve data processed inside CPUs, and cause PC crashes —which should be the least of someone's worries.
One of the affected products is the Intel Management Engine, a technology that is often described as a secret CPU inside the main Intel CPU. The ME component runs independently from the user's main OS, with separate processes, threads, memory manager, hardware bus driver, file system, and many other components. An attacker that exploits a flaw and gains control over the Intel ME has untethered control over the entire computer."
<b>Sidenote here: This is why secret operating systems running without the consumer's knowledge or ability to disable them is a bad thing.</b>
"
According to Intel, the following Intel ME, SPS, and TXE firmware versions are affected:
ME firmware versions 11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20
SPS Firmware version 4.0
TXE version 3.0
According to Intel, the following products incorporate vulnerable firmware versions:
6th, 7th & 8th Generation Intel® Core™ Processor Family
Intel® Xeon® Processor E3-1200 v5 & v6 Product Family
Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family
Intel® Xeon® Processor W Family
Intel® Atom® C3000 Processor Family
Apollo Lake Intel® Atom Processor E3900 series

The company told ZDNet that hackers stole 1.7 million email addresses and passwords, scrambled with the SHA-256 algorithm, which has been passed over in recent years in favor of stronger password scramblers.
Imgur said the breach didn't include personal information because the site has "never asked" for real names, addresses, or phone numbers.
The stolen accounts represent a fraction of Imgur's 150 million monthly users."

And the FCC released its plan to disasemble net neutrality.
In summary, it will:
End Title II protections and erase the three Net Neutrality rules passed at the FCC in 2015 and upheld in court last year.
Legalize internet blocking and discrimination by Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, no questions asked.
Permit throttling back the speeds of different kinds of websites and apps.
Encourage paid prioritization - sticking most sites and apps in the slow lane and reserving the fast lane for the few wealthy companies that can afford special treatment.

CIA to continue cloud push in the name of national security
The intelligence agency's director of digital futures has touted the partnership with AWS as one providing a 'game-changing' environment for the CIA to perform like a Silicon Valley startup while protecting national security.
"
This is concerning to me because national security is very security oriented, and with the number of AWS instances that everyone (including the USG (see other stories tonight)) fail to properly secure, I dont see this ending well. And I also dont like giving amazon access to national security secrets. Giving them power over the infrustrucutre that defends our nation is a little too much power in my opinion.

Ten days after an Amazon S3 server exposed data from the US Army's CENTCOM and PACOM divisions, security researchers have identified another S3 server instance that leaked files from INSCOM, a joint US Army and NSA agency tasked with conducting intelligence, security, and information operations.
Just like the last Army leak, the exposed servers were found by the UpGuard team, who identified an S3 server hosting a small number of files and folders, three of which were freely downloadable.
...
The metadata of files stored on the virtual hard drive allowed researchers to determine the SSD image held troves of highly sensitive files, some of which were classified with the TOP SECRET and NOFORN (NO FOReign Nationals) security classifiers.
"
(See previous story).
This is why I am concerned about putting top secret information on AWS. Even the US Army and NSA cannot keep their things safe, so why should we put more secrets in the cloud?

Android phones gather your location data and send it to Google, even if you’ve turned off location services and don’t have a SIM card, Quartz reported today.
The term “location services” oftentimes refers to exact GPS data for app usage, such as Google Maps finding your best commute route, or Uber figuring out exactly where you’re standing to let drivers know your pickup point. Quartz’s report details a practice in which Google was able to track user locations by triangulating which cell towers were currently servicing a specific device.
"
This is clearly an invasion of privacy when the user has attempted to opt out of location tracking, and it is one of the reasons that I cannot recommend anyone use Android.

Today, Coinbase suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Internal Revenue Service, nearly a year after the case was initially filed. A California federal court has ordered Coinbase to turn over identifying records for all users who have bought, sold, sent, or received more than $20,000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase estimates that 14,355 users meet the government’s requirements. The full order is embedded below.
For each account, the company has been asked to provide the IRS with the user’s name, birth date, address, and taxpayer ID, along with records of all account activity and any associated account statements. The result is both a definitive link to the user’s identity and a comprehensive record of everything they’ve done with their Coinbase account, including other accounts to which they’ve sent money.
The order is significantly narrower than the IRS’s initial request, which asked for records on every single Coinbase account over the same period. That request would also have required all communications between Coinbase and the user, a measure the judge found unnecessarily comprehensive.
"
Legitimacy is a double edged sword. As bitcoin becomes closer to a legitimate currency, the IRS takes interest. So yeah, you do need to pay tax on gains from bitcoin. On the upside, the judge did narrow the request to only information that might actually be relevant to an investigation into tax evasion or money laundering, so thats a small win.

The House Intelligence Committee passed a bill Friday to restrain the government’s access to data collected under a powerful authority to collect foreign intelligence on U.S. soil, weighing in on what has become a wide-ranging debate, just days before Congress must act to keep the surveillance program from expiring.
The committee’s bill would require government agencies to get a court order before viewing the content of communications to or from Americans in the National Security Agency’s database of information collected under the authority, known as Section 702, in criminal cases. That proposal was first floated by the committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, and does not require a similar court order for viewing the contents of queries in national security cases.
"
So I guess its a half loss. On the one hand, section 702 has been reauthorized, which allows for continued spying on American citizens, but on the other hand it is now slightly harder to use that data unless you are the NSA.
So still mostly a loss. But I didnt expect them to give up spying on their own citizens because that would just be too reasonable.

US says it doesn't need secret court's approval to ask for encryption backdoors
...
The government made its remarks in July in response to questions posed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), but they were only made public this weekend.
The implication is that the government can use its legal authority to secretly ask a US-based company for technical assistance, such as building an encryption backdoor into a product, but can petition the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to compel the company if it refuses.
In its answers, the government said it has "not to date" needed to ask the FISC to issue an order to compel a company to backdoor or weaken its encryption.
The government would not say, however, if it's ever asked a company to add an encryption backdoor.
"
This is where the importance of open source software comes in. If the softare is open source, then you very well cant just add a backdoor in without anyone noticing.
Also, this is why spying laws in this country are scary.

A United Nations meeting in Geneva earlier this month on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) was derailed when Russia said they would not adhere to any prohibitions on killer robots, according to Defense One.
The U.N. meeting appeared to be undermined both by Russia’s disinterest in it and the framework of the meeting itself. Member nations attempted to come in and define what LAWS' systems would be, and what restrictions could be developed around autonomous war machines, but no progress was made.
In a statement, Russia said that the lack of already developed war machines makes coming up with prohibitions on such machines difficult.
“According to the Russian Federation, the lack of working samples of such weapons systems remains the main problem in the discussion on LAWS…this can hardly be considered as an argument for taking preventive prohibitive or restrictive measures against LAWS being a by far more complex and wide class of weapons of which the current understanding of humankind is rather approximate,” read the statement.
"
So Russia just said "yeah were making killer robots. and were not gonna stop", which is scary. Note to self: dont piss off russian death robot.

Statistical  “risk  limiting  audits” should be  used after every election to detect software failures and attacks.

NSA's Ragtime program targets Americans, leaked files show
...
The program, known as Ragtime, collects the contents of communications, such as emails and text messages, of foreign nationals under the authority of several US surveillance laws.
...
There were four known versions, according to a 2013 book, released just months before the first documents published from the cache of documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Ragtime-A is said to involve the US-based collection of foreign-to-foreign counterterrorism data; Ragtime-B collects foreign government data that travels through the US; and Ragtime-C focuses on the nuclear counterproliferation effort.
Another program stands for Ragtime-P, which is said to stand for the Patriot Act, which authorizes the collection of bulk metadata on calls and emails sent over the networks of telecom providers. A leaked court order showed Verizon was ordered to turn over customer call records to the NSA on a daily basis. Dozens of other companies have also been compelled to provide data for Ragtime.
But the Ragtime program has many more versions -- including one that appears to involve Americans' data.
The document was found buried in a virtual hard disk, discovered by UpGuard's Chris Vickery.
The document seen by ZDNet, dated November 2011, shows the Ragtime program has eleven variants, including the four that were already known. The document alludes to Ragtime-BQ, F, N, PQ, S, and T.
The eleventh version refers to Ragtime-USP. "USP" is a common term used across the intelligence community to refer to "US person," like a US citizen or lawful permanent resident.
"
So yeah, this is the most blantant the NSA has been about collecting information about US citizens, in a clear violation of our privacy (and our 4th amendment rights).

Intel Fixes Critical Bugs in Management Engine, Its Secret CPU-On-Chip
Intel published a security advisory last night detailing eight vulnerabilities that impact core CPU technologies such as the Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).
The vulnerabilities are severe enough to allow attackers to install rootkits on vulnerable PCs, retrieve data processed inside CPUs, and cause PC crashes —which should be the least of someone's worries.
One of the affected products is the Intel Management Engine, a technology that is often described as a secret CPU inside the main Intel CPU. The ME component runs independently from the user's main OS, with separate processes, threads, memory manager, hardware bus driver, file system, and many other components. An attacker that exploits a flaw and gains control over the Intel ME has untethered control over the entire computer.
The CPU maker has released firmware updates to address these flaws. The updates are not available to the general public, as chipset and motherboard vendors will have to integrate the updates into their own updates. Lenovo has already issued patches for some products that are using vulnerable Intel ME, SPS, or TXE technologies.
"
See the article too see if you are affected and get the appropriate link to your device manufacterer's patch.
But this kind of vulnerability is why having secret parts of the CPU is bad, and why it should be a stateless system. If such vulnerabilities exist, then everyone can be compromized. Many security experts have described Intel ME as a backdoor from the start, and with these vulnerabilities it looks more and more like it is one.

Three security researchers have discovered a variation to an old cryptographic attack that can be exploited to obtain the private encryption key necessary to decrypt sensitive HTTPS traffic under certain conditions.
Named ROBOT, which stands for Return Of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat, this new attack is a variation of the Bleichenbacher attack on the RSA algorithm discovered almost two decades ago.
...
Instead of replacing the insecure RSA algorithm, the designers of the TLS standard decided to add countermeasures to make the brute-force guessing process harder to carry out.
This was an incomplete and insufficient fix for the original Bleichenbacher attack, and since then, researchers have published new variations of the original Bleichenbacher attack in 2003, 2012, 2014, and 2015.
The most recent research on this topic was the DROWN attack, which affected a third of all HTTPS sites, published back in March 2016.
...
Today, a new Bleichenbacher variation named ROBOT came to light, which also relies on skirting the countermeasures put in place by TLS creators back in 1998 and later.
...
Until patches arrive for vulnerable products, the ROBOT research team and US-CERT recommend that owners of vulnerable devices disable TLS session key RSA encryption (also known as RSA encryption mode) on their device. This won't be an issue as most devices also support Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) session key encryption as a better solution for RSA.
27 out of Top 100 sites vulnerable to ROBOT attacks
The ROBOT research team say that despite this being a variation for a 19-year-old attack, 27 of the Alexa Top 100 websites are vulnerable to the ROBOT attack. Vulnerable sites include Facebook and PayPal. The ROBOT attack scientific paper includes a case study how the research team decrypted Facebook traffic.
Other sites outside of the Alexa Top 100 may be vulnerable. Researchers have released a Python script that can help server admins scan for vulnerable hosts, and have also added a ROBOT vulnerability checker on the ROBOT attack homepage.
Just like it was the case with the DROWN flaw, this issue has huge repercussions, as an attacker could log HTTPS traffic and decrypt it at a later date.
It's also worth noticing that an attacker does not obtain the TLS server private key with a ROBOT attack, but individual session keys for each client connection. This means that an attacker does not have access to a universal decryption key, but only to a one-time key for one

No patch for widely used Cisco product
The vulnerability of Cisco's ACE is concerning, because Cisco stopped supporting it several years ago and the researchers said the company has no plans to patch the product line. Even worse, it's not possible to disable RSA encryption in the product, leaving users unable to follow one of the few possible workarounds for those unable to patch. What's more, the researchers said Cisco is currently using ACE to serve content on cisco.com. In an email, Cisco officials wrote:
    Cisco is aware of the newly discovered industry-wide vulnerability that potentially affects products that encrypt using RSA Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 v1.5. When issues such as this arise, we put the security of our customers first and ensure they have the information they need to best protect their networks. Cisco PSIRT has issued a security advisory to provide relevant detail about the issue, noting which Cisco products may be affected and subsequently may require customer attention. This ensures customers are aware of the vulnerability, so they can put best practices in place to mitigate risk and actively monitor their networks for any potential abnormal behavior.

German authorities are preparing a law that will force device manufacturers to include backdoors within their products that law enforcement agencies could use at their discretion for legal investigations. The law would target all modern devices, such as cars, phones, computers, IoT products, and more.
De Maizière claims that companies have a "legal obligation" to introduce backdoors for the use of law enforcement agencies and he also wants to require the industry to disclose its "programming protocols" for future analysis. This latter clause could allow German officials to force companies to disclose details about their encrypted communication practices.
Furthermore, the new law would also give German officials powers akin to the "Hack Back" bill proposed in the US, allowing authorities the power to hack any remote computer. The Minister says this is important to "shut down private computers in the event of a crisis," such as is the case with botnet takedowns.
But privacy advocates who also read the new law proposal say the text also contains verbiage that would allow the German state to intercept any traffic on the Internet [1, 2], effectively setting up a surveillance state with full snooping powers over everyone's online communications. Experts called for caution before approving the new law, which could be abused in its current state.
German authorities anticipated such reaction and said that any access to such data would be allowed only after law enforcement have obtained a court order. But the problem with encryption backdoors is not how you access them, but that they exist in the first place and that they could be abused by ill-intent actors as well.
"
Yeah so if this passed it would be really bad for a few reasons: 1. It would be really bad for the privacy and security of German citizens because of the increased survalence and hacking mandated by the government. 2. It would be bad for everyone in the world because they could compel companies to put in backdoors which affect everyone. 3. Because it sets a precident that this is acceptable, which it absolutely is not.
So yeah, its bad.

"It's time to stop trusting Google search already"
Last weekend, in the hours after a deadly Texas church shooting, Google search promoted false reports about the suspect, suggesting that he was a radical communist affiliated with the antifa movement. The claims popped up in Google's "Popular on Twitter" module, which made them prominently visible - although not the top results - in a search for the alleged killer's name. Of course, the was just the latest instance of a long-standing problem: it was the latest of multiple similar missteps. As usual, Google promised to improve its search results, while the offending tweets disappeared. But telling Google to retrain its algorithms, as appropriate as that demand is, doesn't solve the bigger issue: the search engine's monopoly on truth.

I think that the important part is to remember that Google is not the source of news, it is a search engine. It returns things similar to what you search. The legitmacy of those sources is up to the user to determine.

The real lesson of that self-driving shuttle's first-day accident
The shuttle wasn't at fault, but it might have been able to avert the accident.
...
Wednesday was supposed to be the triumphant launch of a free, driverless shuttle in downtown Las Vegas. ... Instead, within hours, the project was greeted with the worst possible headline: "Self-driving shuttle bus in crash on first day."
The headline, and lots of others like it, were technically accurate but a little misleading. Officials say the other vehicle-a semi truck that bumped into the shuttle while backing up-was at fault. And it was such a low-speed collision that no one was injured. The accident "merely dented the plastic panels on the front of the shuttle," according to Jeff Zurschmeide of Digital Trends.
...
On the other side, the shuttle did exactly what it was programmed to do, and that's a critical point. The self-driving program didn't account for the vehicle in front unexpectedly backing up. We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked) and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss. The shuttle didn't have those responses in its program.
...
Either way, a clear lesson here is that self-driving vehicles need to be able to do more than just avoid causing accidents. They also need to be programmed to take the kind of common-sense steps human drivers would take to prevent accidents even when they're technically the fault of another driver.
"
While definitely not ready for mainstream adoption, as proven by this accident, self driving cars are a major innovation that has the potential to save lives. So I hope that this doesnt slow its adoption once the technology becomes ready to replace human drivers.

Testimony and Statement for the Record of Bruce Schneier
Fellow and Lecturer, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School Fellow, Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School
Hearing on "Securing Consumers' Credit Data in the Age of Digital Commerce"
...
I have eleven main points:
1. The Equifax breach was a serious security breach that puts millions of Americans at risk.
2. Equifax was solely at fault.
3. There are thousands of data brokers with similarly intimate information, similarly at risk.
4. These data brokers deliberately hide their actions, and make it difficult for consumers to learn about or control their data.
5. The existing regulatory structure is inadequate.
6. The market cannot fix this because we are not the customers of data brokers.
7. We need effective regulation of data brokers.
8. Resist complaints from the industry that this is "too hard."
9. This has foreign trade implications.
10. This has national security implications.
11. We need to do something about it.

A team of academics and private industry experts, led by DHS officials, remotely hacked a Boeing 757 airplane parked at an airport in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
The hack took place in September 2016 and was part of a controlled experiment. DHS owned the plane the hack was attempted on, and pilots had no knowledge that the research team was trying to break into the plane.
The DHS-led team said they didn't have physical access to interact with any system on the plane and all was done remotely via "radio frequency communications." The team needed only two days to come up with the hack and execute it.
"
We definitely need to consider the security implications of our infrastructure and transportation being so heavily connected. Hopefully the manufacturers will build products more securely before anyone gets hurt.

The final results from DEFCON hackers were published in a report this fall from Verified Voting. That report, co-authored by many, including DEFCON founder Jeff Moss, was damning:
"The results were sobering. By the end of the conference, every piece of equipment in the Voting Village was effectively breached in some manner. Participants with little prior knowledge and only limited tools and resources were quite capable of undermining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems...The DEFCON Voting Village showed that technical minds with little or no previous knowledge about voting machines, without even being provided proper documentation or tools, can still learn how to hack the machines within tens of minutes or a few hours."

Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) wants the US to impose net neutrality rules on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, and other Web companies.
Net neutrality rules today apply only to Internet service providers, such as cable companies and mobile carriers. ISPs are not allowed to block, throttle, or demand payments to prioritize delivery of lawful Internet traffic. The rules are meant to give all websites-both the established players and startups-a fair shot at reaching Internet users.
But Franken argues that similar non-discrimination rules should apply to the most dominant websites.
"As tech giants become a new kind of Internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here: no one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't," Franken wrote yesterday in an op-ed for The Guardian. "Facebook, Google, and Amazon-like ISPs-should be 'neutral' in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms."

Im not sure how I feel about this. For ISPs its rather simple: I pay you for a, say for instance, 25 mbps connection to the internet. When I request information, I expect that the ISP will deliver it to me unaltered and at the speed I paid for, not at a slower speed, not with additional ads, and not blocked altogether. Both that statement and the implementation are straightforward.
How exactly net neutrality applies to google and facebook is unclear. What content should they be neutral with? How exactly should that be implemented? The article goes on to say that those details have not yet been thought about and that additional hearings will happen, so I will be following this closely.

WikiLeaks published the first-ever batch of source code for CIA cyber-weapons. The source code released today is for a toolkit named Hive, a so-called implant framework, a system that allows CIA operatives to control the malware it deploys on infected computers.
From March to August this year, WikiLeaks has released only documentation for supposed CIA cyber-weapons the organization claims were stolen from the CIA by hackers and insiders, and then handed over to its employees.
Those releases were part of a series of leaks WikiLeaks called Vault 7. Now, WikiLeaks says Hive is just the first of a long string of similar releases, a series WikiLeaks calls Vault 8, which will consist of source code for tools previously released in the Vault 7 series.
"
The existance of the code is not anything Id me concerned about. Its basically a RAT (remote access tool), many of which are commercially available for helping people with technical problems by doing it for them remotely (I believe teamviewer is one of the comerical products). But I am looking forward to the exploits, and getting patches for them.

DOJ: Strong encryption that we don't have access to is "unreasonable"
...
Poison the well
The DOJ's position runs counter to the consensus of information security experts, who say that it is impossible to build the strongest encryption system possible that would also allow the government access under certain conditions.
"Of course, criminals and terrorists have used, are using, and will use encryption to hide their planning from the authorities, just as they will use many aspects of society's capabilities and infrastructure: cars, restaurants, telecommunications," Bruce Schneier, a well-known cryptographer, wrote last year.
"In general, we recognize that such things can be used by both honest and dishonest people. Society thrives nonetheless because the honest so outnumber the dishonest. Compare this with the tactic of secretly poisoning all the food at a restaurant. Yes, we might get lucky and poison a terrorist before he strikes, but we'll harm all the innocent customers in the process. Weakening encryption for everyone is harmful in exactly the same way."
Rosenstein closed his interview by noting that he understands re-engineering encryption to accommodate government may make it weaker.
"And I think that's a legitimate issue that we can debate-how much risk are we willing to take in return for the reward?" he said.
"My point is simply that I think somebody needs to consider what's on the other side of the balance. There is a cost to having impregnable security, and we've talked about some of the aspects of that. The cost is that criminals are going to be able to get away with stuff, and that's going to prevent us in law enforcement from holding them accountable."

Thing is, encryption is not a dimmer switch. "You cannot create encryption that only angels can open and demons cannot. Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed, or less of an angel than they appear."
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPBH1eW28mo" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPBH1eW28mo</a>
I understand that criminals will use encryption, but weakening encryption would cause much more harm than good.
