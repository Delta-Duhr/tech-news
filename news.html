Spectre and Meltdown continue to be really bad, with some vendors pulling BIOS updates because of crashes and booting issues.

As for everything else (OS, software, other vendor BIOS) continue updating because this vulnerability will take some time to fully fix.
More updates on all of this chaos:

“Meltdown” and “Spectre”: Every modern processor has unfixable security flaws
Immediate concern is for Intel chips, but everyone is at risk.
Windows, Linux, and macOS have all received security patches that significantly alter how the operating systems handle virtual memory in order to protect against a hitherto undisclosed flaw. This is more than a little notable; it's been clear that Microsoft and the Linux kernel developers have been informed of some non-public security issue and have been rushing to fix it.

On the last day of 2017, a security researcher going online by the pseudonym of Siguza published details about a macOS vulnerability affecting all Mac operating system versions released since 2002, and possibly earlier. Siguza did not notify Apple in advance, so at the time of writing, there is no fix for this flaw. Despite the doom and gloom, the vulnerability is only a local privilege escalation (LPE) flaw that can only be exploited with local access to a computer or after an attacker has already got a foothold on a machine. The vulnerability grants root access to an attacker.
Bleeping Computer has reached out to Apple for comment on the vulnerability. Taking into account the holiday season, Apple will most likely not release an update in the following days.
...
In addition, LPE flaws are not considered critical, and it's likely that Apple won't release an emergency update to fix the issue, but address it as part of its next monthly security update train.

"Researchers at the University at Buffalo have discovered a way to identify smartphones by analyzing just a single photo taken by the device. The researchers centered on a flaw in digital imaging called photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) to do so. PRNU happens when the imperfections in the manufacturing process of each camera’s sensors create tiny variations. Those variations can cause the millions of pixels in the camera’s sensor to project colors that are slightly brighter or darker than normal, which creates a systemic distortion in the photo called pattern noise. This is invisible to the naked eye, and is extracted by special filters — where each pattern is unique for each camera. This process to analyze images usually requires 50 photos taken by a camera, but the study found that only one photo is needed for smartphones, as the image sensor inside phones are tens of times smaller." <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771854/researchers-study-smartphone-photo-id-analysis">https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771854/researchers-study-smartphone-photo-id-analysis</a>

Each record contains a basic collected data, including the user's full name, email addresses, and how many days the app was installed. Each record also included a user's precise location, including their city and country. More complete records also include the device's IMSI and IMEI number, the device's make and model, its screen resolution, and the device's specific Android version. A large portion of the records also included the user's phone number and the name of their cell phone provider, and in some cases their IP address and name of their internet provider if connected to Wi-Fi. Many records contain specific details of a user's public Google profile, including email addresses, dates of birth, genders, and profile photos. We also found several tables of contact data uploaded from a user's phone. One table listed 10.7 million email addresses, while another contained 374.6 million phone numbers.

"Intel published a security advisory last night detailing eight vulnerabilities that impact core CPU technologies such as the Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).
The vulnerabilities are severe enough to allow attackers to install rootkits on vulnerable PCs, retrieve data processed inside CPUs, and cause PC crashes —which should be the least of someone's worries.
One of the affected products is the Intel Management Engine, a technology that is often described as a secret CPU inside the main Intel CPU. The ME component runs independently from the user's main OS, with separate processes, threads, memory manager, hardware bus driver, file system, and many other components. An attacker that exploits a flaw and gains control over the Intel ME has untethered control over the entire computer."
<b>Sidenote here: This is why secret operating systems running without the consumer's knowledge or ability to disable them is a bad thing.</b>
"
According to Intel, the following Intel ME, SPS, and TXE firmware versions are affected:
ME firmware versions 11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20
SPS Firmware version 4.0
TXE version 3.0
According to Intel, the following products incorporate vulnerable firmware versions:
6th, 7th & 8th Generation Intel® Core™ Processor Family
Intel® Xeon® Processor E3-1200 v5 & v6 Product Family
Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family
Intel® Xeon® Processor W Family

"Imgur, one of the world's most visited websites, has confirmed a hack dating back to 2014.
The company told ZDNet that hackers stole 1.7 million email addresses and passwords, scrambled with the SHA-256 algorithm, which has been passed over in recent years in favor of stronger password scramblers.
Imgur said the breach didn't include personal information because the site has "never asked" for real names, addresses, or phone numbers.
The stolen accounts represent a fraction of Imgur's 150 million monthly users."

And the FCC released its plan to disasemble net neutrality.
In summary, it will:
End Title II protections and erase the three Net Neutrality rules passed at the FCC in 2015 and upheld in court last year.
Legalize internet blocking and discrimination by Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, no questions asked.
Permit throttling back the speeds of different kinds of websites and apps.
Encourage paid prioritization - sticking most sites and apps in the slow lane and reserving the fast lane for the few wealthy companies that can afford special treatment.

Meltdown and Spectre Update:
Patches(and updates to previous patches) continue to be rolled out. There have been some notable problems with some patches, although I think most of those have been resolved at this point. Remember, while these vulnerabilities mainly affect Intel CPUs, others are not entirely immune, so everyone should patch. For these vulnerabilities, there are three levels you need to patch: 1. Your BIOS/CPU microcode. 2. Your operating system/kernel and 3. your software, particularly your web browser and anything that interacts with the internet.

Loosely defined as any gadget or gizmo that connects to the Internet but which most consumers probably wouldn’t begin to know how to secure, IoT encompasses everything from security cameras, routers and digital video recorders to printers, wearable devices and “smart” lightbulbs.
-Rule #1: Avoid connecting your devices directly to the Internet
-Rule #2: If you can, change the thing’s default credentials
-Rule #3: Update the firmware.
-Rule #4: Check the defaults
-Rule #5: Avoid IoT devices that advertise Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities
-Rule #6: Consider the cost.

The EFF and mobile security company Lookout uncovered a global espionage campaign targeting primarily mobile users that downloaded fake secure messaging applications. The EFF and Lookout traced the “Dark Caracal” malware to a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut.
EFF Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin said that:
    People in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Lebanon, and France have been hit by Dark Caracal. Targets include military personnel, activists, journalists, and lawyers, and the types of stolen data range from call records and audio recordings to documents and photos. This is a very large, global campaign, focused on mobile devices. Mobile is the future of spying, because phones are full of so much data about a person’s day-to-day life.

Our most sophisticated crime-predicting algorithms may not be as good as we thought. A study published today in Science Advances takes a look at the popular COMPAS algorithm — used to assess the likelihood that a given defendant will reoffend — and finds the algorithm is no more accurate than the average person’s guess. If the findings hold, they would be a black eye for sentencing algorithms in general, indicating we may simply not have the tools to accurately predict whether a defendant will commit further crimes.
Developed by Equivant (formerly Northpointe), the COMPAS algorithm examines a defendant’s criminal record alongside a series of other factors to assess how likely they are to be arrested again in the next two years. COMPAS’ risk assessment can then inform a judge’s decisions about bail or even sentencing. If the algorithm is inaccurate, the result could be a longer sentence for an otherwise low-risk defendant, a significant harm for anyone impacted.
Reached by The Verge, Equivant contested the accuracy of the paper in a lengthy statement, calling the work “highly misleading.”
"
The article continues to descibe other problems with COMPAS, such as a racial bias, other studies finding its inaccuracy, and COMPAS' response. As a scientist, I recognize that more data is necesary to determine if it really is as bad as they claim. But with the data that we have avaiable, it looks like this algorithm may be causing serious harm by predicting that people are likely to comitt additional crimes when they would not.

Intel CPU Bugs: Meltdown and Spectre
Okay so lets get the FUD out of the way. 4 days before the news about the bug could have gotten out (because thats when it would be posted to the Linux kernel developer mailing list), Intel's CEO sold every share in his company that he was legally allowed to share (source: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-ceo-krzanich-sold-shares-after-company-was-informed-of-chip-flaw-2018-1">http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-ceo-krzanich-sold-shares-after-company-was-informed-of-chip-flaw-2018-1</a>). Also, two proposed names for the patches had acryonms UASS and FUCKWIT, although the linux kernel dev team went with KPTI (kernel page table isolation). Finally, two lines of code were added to the linux kernel basically saying "if the CPU vendor is not AMD, then it is insecure". Intels stock went down substantially when the news broke, and AMD's stock went up substantially.
Also, pretty much everyone hates Intel right now because they made a whole bunch of devs work a lot of overtime over new years to fix all this.
Okay, with that out of the way the rest of this recap will be about the technical fuckups, what you need to do to fix it, and what impact that will have.
1. How did this happen?
Intel CPU's use speculative execution to speed up execution. This is where the CPU guesses what the running program will do next, and does that very quickly. It then checks if that was the right action. If it is right (which it is a good enough percent of the time to make this actually speed up the CPU), then it continues as normal, otherwise it undoes the action and does the correct one. So wheres the problem? Theres certain things the CPU wont or cant undo. So if the guessing in the CPU is made to access memory it shouldnt be allowed to, and save that value into the CPU cache (which the CPU wont undo changes to because that would break things), then even after the program is caught reading memory it isnt supposed to, and then it is "undone", it still has the information saved in the CPU cache, which it may be able to read.
The other exploit is similar but not quite the same. If you want to read the technical breakdowns, heres the links:

And a somewhat less technical breakdown: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/6/16854668/meltdown-spectre-hack-explained-bank-heist-analogy">https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/6/16854668/meltdown-spectre-hack-explained-bank-heist-analogy</a>
2. What can you as a user do to stop them?
Well, as of the 3rd, all major OS vendors have released patches, so update your OS now! (devices that need to be patched: everything. This includes macOS, iOS, Android, WIndows, and all varients of linux)(including your kernels linux users, not just userland packages)(and windows users, if you use antivirus make sure it isnt blocking the patch, there are reports of that happening... I recommend not using antivirus anyway...). You should also patch if you dont have an Intel CPU, because AMD and ARM CPUs were also (to a much, <em>much</em> lesser extent) affected by some speculative execution bugs.
You should also keep an eye out for firmware patches in the coming weeks, as Intel has promised to provide firmware patches to hopefully also disarm Specture and Meltdown. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/intel-promises-firmware-updates-for-most-modern-cpus-by-the-end-of-next-week/">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/intel-promises-firmware-updates-for-most-modern-cpus-by-the-end-of-next-week/</a>
3. What impact will this have?
Well, the answer is two fold. First, there may be a 5-30% performance degredation on Intel CPUs, althrough Google has unveiled a new patch that may reduce  that to the 0-1.5% range. They have submitted this patch to the linux kernel, and while I am unsure if it is currently being pushed to users or if it is still under testing, I like to see large corporations doing good work and then giving it away to benefit everyone. I think I'll count that as another tick in the "Good guy google" tally. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-unveils-new-retpoline-coding-technique-for-mitigating-spectre-attacks/">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-unveils-new-retpoline-coding-technique-for-mitigating-spectre-attacks/</a>
And what is the long term impact of these vulnerabilities? Well, thats a bit tougher to answer. Heres a few things:
a. Any system that doesnt get an update is going to be at huge risk because of web based execution vectors, which have been confirmed by Mozilla <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mozilla-confirms-web-based-execution-vector-for-meltdown-and-spectre-attacks/">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mozilla-confirms-web-based-execution-vector-for-meltdown-and-spectre-attacks/</a>. This is going to be especially damning for older hardware and OSes that may not recieve updates.
b. Intel is facing three class action lawsuits about "defective chips". <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/meltdown-lawsuits-intel-defective-chips,36233.html">http://www.tomshardware.com/news/meltdown-lawsuits-intel-defective-chips,36233.html</a> I dont think much will come of this except for negative press. But that might hurt a lot.
c. (Opinion) I think as the number of Intel vulnerabilities continues to increase (remember the horrible Intel ME backdoors a while back. And then the other ones. And now with Meltdown and Spectre being called the worst ever CPU bugs...), security conscious consumers will begin looking at other alternatives. AMD has recently allowed their users to disable the Platform Security coProcessor (their version of Intel's Management Engine (ME)), and they were boasting about how their architecture handles security much better. I would love to see this be a point of competition between the two companies, but I am more excited for RISC-V.
"
The RISC-V Foundation says that no currently announced RISC-V CPU is vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre and, in the wake of those bugs, stressed the importance of open-source development and a modern ISA in preventing vulnerabilities.
...
The RISC-V foundation stresses that the open-source nature of the RISC-V is its greatest advantage in preventing hardware vulnerabilities. There is already discussion happening in the RISC-V development community on how to construct the ISA to explicitly prevent speculative execution vulnerabilities in CPUs that implement it. According to the organization, RISC-V’s open-source development will lead to a more secure design.

With the amount of uproar Ive heard about Intel's closed-source, proprietary, vulnerable Management Engine (ME), I wouldnt be surprized if Intel and AMD started moving towards open source to prove their security. I would hope for greater adoption of RISC-V, but a more realistic scenario would see a greater level of transparancy by Intel and AMD as it relates to ME/PSP and to other areas of their chips' security.

Overall, patch all of the things. But if you are making a CPU purchase in the near future, maybe dont go with Intel. Particularly not an Intel CPU that is 8th gen or older, as they likely will all contain the vulnerability(even though it can be patched on a software level, still).

Headline: "Chrome is turning into the new Internet Explorer 6"
The article argues that Chrome is starting to not follow internet standards, which ensure that content made for one browser will work the same in all browsers. This created a huge problem back in the IE6 days, when it had market dominance and largely ignored web standards.
Web sites began to code their websites only for IE6, and oftentimes they wouldnt work elsewhere. As time went on, better browsers came along (introducing tabbed browsing and pop-up blockers). MS countered with IE7, which had those features, but in 2008 Google entered the market with Chrome. They focused on respecting HTML5 and passed both the Acid1 and Acid2 tests, something IE failed to do. Developers, followed by consumers, flocked to these new browsers.
This new wave of browsers that respected web standards created a new era of competition. Because web sites would work well on every browser, customers would chose the browser with the best features, and browsers got better for it.
The guidelines also draw a distinction between “basic” and “advanced” searches. If officers connect to the phone (through a wired or wireless connection) and copy or analyze anything on it using external devices, that’s an advanced search, and it can only be carried out with reasonable suspicion of illegal activity or a national security concern. A supervisor can approve the search, and “many factors” might create reasonable suspicion, including a terrorist watchlist flag or “other articulable factors.”
The ACLU offered limited praise for this update. “It is positive that CBP’s policy would at least require officers to have some level of suspicion before copying and using electronic methods to search a traveler’s electronic device,” wrote legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani in a press release. But the group also said it “falls far short” of requiring a full search warrant. “The policy would still enable officers at the border to manually sift through a traveler’s photos, emails, documents, and other information stored on a device without individualized suspicion of any kind.” The ACLU called on Congress to press for greater limits on CPB powers.

"New US Customs guidelines limit copying files and searching cloud data"
"
The US Customs and Border Protection agency has updated its guidelines for electronic border searches, clarifying what remain broad and potentially invasive procedures. The directive was published today, and it adds new detail to border search rules that were last officially updated in 2009.
Officers can still request that people unlock electronic devices for inspection when they’re entering the US, and they can still look through any files or apps on those devices. But consistent with a statement from acting commissioner Kevin McAleenan last summer, they’re explicitly banned from accessing cloud data — per these guidelines, that means anything that can’t be accessed while the phone’s data connection is disabled.
The guidelines also draw a distinction between “basic” and “advanced” searches. If officers connect to the phone (through a wired or wireless connection) and copy or analyze anything on it using external devices, that’s an advanced search, and it can only be carried out with reasonable suspicion of illegal activity or a national security concern. A supervisor can approve the search, and “many factors” might create reasonable suspicion, including a terrorist watchlist flag or “other articulable factors.”

"Security Flaw in AMD's Secure Chip-On-Chip Processor Disclosed Online"
"
AMD has fixed, but not yet released BIOS/UEFI/firmware updates for the general public for a security flaw affecting the AMD Secure Processor.
This component, formerly known as AMD PSP (Platform Security Processor), is a chip-on-chip security system, similar to Intel's much-hated Management Engine (ME).
The researcher claims that an attacker could use specially-crafted EK certificates to get remote code execution rights on the AMD Secure Processor, allowing him to compromise its security.
Cohen said that some basic mitigation techniques such as "stack cookies, NX stack, ASLR" were not implemented in AMD's Secure Processor, making exploitation trivial.
The Google researcher reported the flaw to AMD in September, and AMD told the researcher in December that they've developed a patch and were preparing to roll it out.
Coincidentally, on Reddit [1, 2], some users reported seeing a new option to disable AMD PSP support, but it's unclear if this new option is related to the patches AMD was preparing to roll out for Cohen's findings.
The option to disable PSP is somewhat unique in the CPU world. For example, Intel has never allowed users to disable its Management Engine secret coprocessor, despite a long list of security flaws that have been reported in the component.
"
Yeah so look out for BIOS updates if you ahve an AMD CPU. Also, maybe disable PSP to minimize the attack surface (less running code for there to be vulnerabilities in).
But I really like how AMD allows users to disable PSP, which seems to indicate that it is not just a hardware backdoor, unlike Intel ME which they only disable for specific government-only computers.

"In less than two weeks, Congress could expand the NSA’s broad surveillance powers. Worse, Congress could do this by dodging a vote on the issue itself, instead sneaking it into separate, must-pass spending legislation before year’s end to keep the government open. Don’t let that happen."
<a href="https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-expansion-of-nsa-spying">https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-expansion-of-nsa-spying</a>
"
Both of the bills, which are pending respectively in the House of Representatives and the Senate, would:
    Grant authority to restart “about” collection, an invasive type of surveillance that was heavily criticized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for privacy violations.
    Fail to protect Americans from FBI agents reading their private communications without first obtaining a warrant.
...
Section 702 is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2017, meaning Congress needs to decide fast on whether to continue the law, reform it, or let it lapse. But there is no consensus, and some lawmakers are tempted to attach Section 702 reauthorization language, without any Section 702 reform, into entirely separate, must-pass funding bills that are meant to prevent the government from shutting down. This maneuver would rob surveillance reform of its own vote—as well as transparent debate.
Tell Congress that these bills, on their own, must be stopped. Tell Congress that these bills, attached to unrelated funding legislation, are even more unacceptable.
Surveillance reform needs its own vote—and that must be a vote against H.R. 4478 and S. 2010.

Nunes’ Warrantless Surveillance Bill (H.R. 4478)
Less than a month ago, Rep. Devin Nunes, from the 22nd Congressional district of California, introduced a new surveillance bill in the House to match a similar bill from Sen. Richard Burr, the co-author (along with Sen. Dianne Feinstein) of a previous anti-encryption bill. Nunes’ bill expanded the definition of a “foreign target” to allow intelligence agencies to spy on even more people at once, including Americans.
Whether intentionally or inadvertently, the bill also seemed to target privacy tools such as Tor or the Tor-enabled TAILS operating system. The bill would also make warrants “optional” for intelligence and law enforcement agencies, which would essentially nullify the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.
As the EFF pointed out when the bill was introduced, having to obtain a warrant before spying on an American is not an “option” for the government - it’s mandated by the most fundamental law in the country: the Constitution.

"
One of the NSA’s most important surveillance authorizations is set to expire on December 31st, and all year, reformers have been looking at the reauthorization as a way to pare back the agency’s powers. But after months of negotiating terms, Congress is now preparing a bill with none of the proposed limits, and a number of troubling new measures that say could greatly expand the agency’s power.
Submitted by Rep. Nunes on Tuesday afternoon, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 is based on a previous bill submitted by Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), generally seen as the most NSA-friendly of the proposals. The current bill is narrower than Burr’s proposal in some areas, but makes a significant expansion to “about” collection, which allows the NSA to search communications that mention a given target but was not sent or received by the target. In practical terms, that could mean searching a message simply because it contains an email address, phone number, or other string of characters associated with a target.
...
The bill would also codify the backdoor search loophole, which allows for intelligence agencies to search communications to and from US citizens without obtaining a warrant, as long as those communications were intercepted overseas. While that loophole is most associated with the NSA, it also includes domestic agencies like the FBI, which the current bill says “has the discretion to seek a warrant” if the bureau deems it necessary.
The bill has drawn harsh criticism from reform groups, with the Open Technology Institute calling it “by far the worst option” for reauthorizing 702.
“If this bill passes, we will miss the opportunity to prevent the FBI from searching through NSA databases for American communications without a warrant,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote in its statement on the bill. “Worse, nothing will be done to rein in the massive, unconstitutional surveillance of the NSA on Americans or innocent technology users worldwide.”

Biometric And DNA Collection At Border (S.2192)
If the NSA mass surveillance expansion was not enough, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) introduced a bill that seems to contain 1984’s list of things to do for oppressive governments: biometric screening, DNA collection, surveillance drones, social media snooping, license plate readers. Grassley’s “the Secure ACT” (S.2192) seems to be an all you can you can spy-on authoritarian government buffet.
S.2192 borrows heavily from other House and Senate bills (H.R. 3548 and S. 1757) introduced earlier this year Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and opposed by the EFF.
Sen. Coryn’s bill would require that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS):
        Collect biometric information from all people who exit the U.S., including U.S. and foreign citizens.
        Collect DNA and other biometric information from “any individual filing an application, petition, or other request for immigration benefit or status.”
        Share biometric information about immigrants with the FBI, Defense Department, and State Department.
        Review social media accounts of visa applicants from “high-risk countries.”
        Deploy drones at the U.S. border.
The bill would apply to both foreigners as well as all Americans passing through U.S. airports. The EFF believes that border security should be balanced with essential civil rights that both citizens and foreigners should have in airports, and that these bills violate that principle.

CIA to continue cloud push in the name of national security
The intelligence agency's director of digital futures has touted the partnership with AWS as one providing a 'game-changing' environment for the CIA to perform like a Silicon Valley startup while protecting national security.
"
This is concerning to me because national security is very security oriented, and with the number of AWS instances that everyone (including the USG (see other stories tonight)) fail to properly secure, I dont see this ending well. And I also dont like giving amazon access to national security secrets. Giving them power over the infrustrucutre that defends our nation is a little too much power in my opinion.

Ten days after an Amazon S3 server exposed data from the US Army's CENTCOM and PACOM divisions, security researchers have identified another S3 server instance that leaked files from INSCOM, a joint US Army and NSA agency tasked with conducting intelligence, security, and information operations.
Just like the last Army leak, the exposed servers were found by the UpGuard team, who identified an S3 server hosting a small number of files and folders, three of which were freely downloadable.
...
The metadata of files stored on the virtual hard drive allowed researchers to determine the SSD image held troves of highly sensitive files, some of which were classified with the TOP SECRET and NOFORN (NO FOReign Nationals) security classifiers.
"
(See previous story).
This is why I am concerned about putting top secret information on AWS. Even the US Army and NSA cannot keep their things safe, so why should we put more secrets in the cloud?

Android phones gather your location data and send it to Google, even if you’ve turned off location services and don’t have a SIM card, Quartz reported today.
The term “location services” oftentimes refers to exact GPS data for app usage, such as Google Maps finding your best commute route, or Uber figuring out exactly where you’re standing to let drivers know your pickup point. Quartz’s report details a practice in which Google was able to track user locations by triangulating which cell towers were currently servicing a specific device.
"
This is clearly an invasion of privacy when the user has attempted to opt out of location tracking, and it is one of the reasons that I cannot recommend anyone use Android.

Today, Coinbase suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Internal Revenue Service, nearly a year after the case was initially filed. A California federal court has ordered Coinbase to turn over identifying records for all users who have bought, sold, sent, or received more than $20,000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase estimates that 14,355 users meet the government’s requirements. The full order is embedded below.
For each account, the company has been asked to provide the IRS with the user’s name, birth date, address, and taxpayer ID, along with records of all account activity and any associated account statements. The result is both a definitive link to the user’s identity and a comprehensive record of everything they’ve done with their Coinbase account, including other accounts to which they’ve sent money.
The order is significantly narrower than the IRS’s initial request, which asked for records on every single Coinbase account over the same period. That request would also have required all communications between Coinbase and the user, a measure the judge found unnecessarily comprehensive.
"
Legitimacy is a double edged sword. As bitcoin becomes closer to a legitimate currency, the IRS takes interest. So yeah, you do need to pay tax on gains from bitcoin. On the upside, the judge did narrow the request to only information that might actually be relevant to an investigation into tax evasion or money laundering, so thats a small win.

The House Intelligence Committee passed a bill Friday to restrain the government’s access to data collected under a powerful authority to collect foreign intelligence on U.S. soil, weighing in on what has become a wide-ranging debate, just days before Congress must act to keep the surveillance program from expiring.
The committee’s bill would require government agencies to get a court order before viewing the content of communications to or from Americans in the National Security Agency’s database of information collected under the authority, known as Section 702, in criminal cases. That proposal was first floated by the committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, and does not require a similar court order for viewing the contents of queries in national security cases.
"
So I guess its a half loss. On the one hand, section 702 has been reauthorized, which allows for continued spying on American citizens, but on the other hand it is now slightly harder to use that data unless you are the NSA.
So still mostly a loss. But I didnt expect them to give up spying on their own citizens because that would just be too reasonable.

US says it doesn't need secret court's approval to ask for encryption backdoors
...
The government made its remarks in July in response to questions posed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), but they were only made public this weekend.
The implication is that the government can use its legal authority to secretly ask a US-based company for technical assistance, such as building an encryption backdoor into a product, but can petition the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to compel the company if it refuses.
In its answers, the government said it has "not to date" needed to ask the FISC to issue an order to compel a company to backdoor or weaken its encryption.
The government would not say, however, if it's ever asked a company to add an encryption backdoor.
"
This is where the importance of open source software comes in. If the softare is open source, then you very well cant just add a backdoor in without anyone noticing.
Also, this is why spying laws in this country are scary.

A United Nations meeting in Geneva earlier this month on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) was derailed when Russia said they would not adhere to any prohibitions on killer robots, according to Defense One.
The U.N. meeting appeared to be undermined both by Russia’s disinterest in it and the framework of the meeting itself. Member nations attempted to come in and define what LAWS' systems would be, and what restrictions could be developed around autonomous war machines, but no progress was made.
In a statement, Russia said that the lack of already developed war machines makes coming up with prohibitions on such machines difficult.
“According to the Russian Federation, the lack of working samples of such weapons systems remains the main problem in the discussion on LAWS…this can hardly be considered as an argument for taking preventive prohibitive or restrictive measures against LAWS being a by far more complex and wide class of weapons of which the current understanding of humankind is rather approximate,” read the statement.
"
So Russia just said "yeah were making killer robots. and were not gonna stop", which is scary. Note to self: dont piss off russian death robot.

NSA's Ragtime program targets Americans, leaked files show
...
The program, known as Ragtime, collects the contents of communications, such as emails and text messages, of foreign nationals under the authority of several US surveillance laws.
...
There were four known versions, according to a 2013 book, released just months before the first documents published from the cache of documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Ragtime-A is said to involve the US-based collection of foreign-to-foreign counterterrorism data; Ragtime-B collects foreign government data that travels through the US; and Ragtime-C focuses on the nuclear counterproliferation effort.
Another program stands for Ragtime-P, which is said to stand for the Patriot Act, which authorizes the collection of bulk metadata on calls and emails sent over the networks of telecom providers. A leaked court order showed Verizon was ordered to turn over customer call records to the NSA on a daily basis. Dozens of other companies have also been compelled to provide data for Ragtime.
But the Ragtime program has many more versions -- including one that appears to involve Americans' data.
The document was found buried in a virtual hard disk, discovered by UpGuard's Chris Vickery.
The document seen by ZDNet, dated November 2011, shows the Ragtime program has eleven variants, including the four that were already known. The document alludes to Ragtime-BQ, F, N, PQ, S, and T.
The eleventh version refers to Ragtime-USP. "USP" is a common term used across the intelligence community to refer to "US person," like a US citizen or lawful permanent resident.
"
So yeah, this is the most blantant the NSA has been about collecting information about US citizens, in a clear violation of our privacy (and our 4th amendment rights).

Intel Fixes Critical Bugs in Management Engine, Its Secret CPU-On-Chip
Intel published a security advisory last night detailing eight vulnerabilities that impact core CPU technologies such as the Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).
The vulnerabilities are severe enough to allow attackers to install rootkits on vulnerable PCs, retrieve data processed inside CPUs, and cause PC crashes —which should be the least of someone's worries.
One of the affected products is the Intel Management Engine, a technology that is often described as a secret CPU inside the main Intel CPU. The ME component runs independently from the user's main OS, with separate processes, threads, memory manager, hardware bus driver, file system, and many other components. An attacker that exploits a flaw and gains control over the Intel ME has untethered control over the entire computer.
The CPU maker has released firmware updates to address these flaws. The updates are not available to the general public, as chipset and motherboard vendors will have to integrate the updates into their own updates. Lenovo has already issued patches for some products that are using vulnerable Intel ME, SPS, or TXE technologies.
"
See the article too see if you are affected and get the appropriate link to your device manufacterer's patch.
But this kind of vulnerability is why having secret parts of the CPU is bad, and why it should be a stateless system. If such vulnerabilities exist, then everyone can be compromized. Many security experts have described Intel ME as a backdoor from the start, and with these vulnerabilities it looks more and more like it is one.

Three security researchers have discovered a variation to an old cryptographic attack that can be exploited to obtain the private encryption key necessary to decrypt sensitive HTTPS traffic under certain conditions.
Named ROBOT, which stands for Return Of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat, this new attack is a variation of the Bleichenbacher attack on the RSA algorithm discovered almost two decades ago.
...
Instead of replacing the insecure RSA algorithm, the designers of the TLS standard decided to add countermeasures to make the brute-force guessing process harder to carry out.
This was an incomplete and insufficient fix for the original Bleichenbacher attack, and since then, researchers have published new variations of the original Bleichenbacher attack in 2003, 2012, 2014, and 2015.
The most recent research on this topic was the DROWN attack, which affected a third of all HTTPS sites, published back in March 2016.
...
Today, a new Bleichenbacher variation named ROBOT came to light, which also relies on skirting the countermeasures put in place by TLS creators back in 1998 and later.
...
Until patches arrive for vulnerable products, the ROBOT research team and US-CERT recommend that owners of vulnerable devices disable TLS session key RSA encryption (also known as RSA encryption mode) on their device. This won't be an issue as most devices also support Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) session key encryption as a better solution for RSA.
27 out of Top 100 sites vulnerable to ROBOT attacks
The ROBOT research team say that despite this being a variation for a 19-year-old attack, 27 of the Alexa Top 100 websites are vulnerable to the ROBOT attack. Vulnerable sites include Facebook and PayPal. The ROBOT attack scientific paper includes a case study how the research team decrypted Facebook traffic.
Other sites outside of the Alexa Top 100 may be vulnerable. Researchers have released a Python script that can help server admins scan for vulnerable hosts, and have also added a ROBOT vulnerability checker on the ROBOT attack homepage.
Just like it was the case with the DROWN flaw, this issue has huge repercussions, as an attacker could log HTTPS traffic and decrypt it at a later date.
It's also worth noticing that an attacker does not obtain the TLS server private key with a ROBOT attack, but individual session keys for each client connection. This means that an attacker does not have access to a universal decryption key, but only to a one-time key for one

The researchers aren't naming developers of other vulnerable software who have fixes pending. The researchers also warned that sites that didn't test positive in the recent scans may still be vulnerable to variations of the exploit.
...
No patch for widely used Cisco product
The vulnerability of Cisco's ACE is concerning, because Cisco stopped supporting it several years ago and the researchers said the company has no plans to patch the product line. Even worse, it's not possible to disable RSA encryption in the product, leaving users unable to follow one of the few possible workarounds for those unable to patch. What's more, the researchers said Cisco is currently using ACE to serve content on cisco.com. In an email, Cisco officials wrote:
    Cisco is aware of the newly discovered industry-wide vulnerability that potentially affects products that encrypt using RSA Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 v1.5. When issues such as this arise, we put the security of our customers first and ensure they have the information they need to best protect their networks. Cisco PSIRT has issued a security advisory to provide relevant detail about the issue, noting which Cisco products may be affected and subsequently may require customer attention. This ensures customers are aware of the vulnerability, so they can put best practices in place to mitigate risk and actively monitor their networks for any potential abnormal behavior.

German authorities are preparing a law that will force device manufacturers to include backdoors within their products that law enforcement agencies could use at their discretion for legal investigations. The law would target all modern devices, such as cars, phones, computers, IoT products, and more.
De Maizière claims that companies have a "legal obligation" to introduce backdoors for the use of law enforcement agencies and he also wants to require the industry to disclose its "programming protocols" for future analysis. This latter clause could allow German officials to force companies to disclose details about their encrypted communication practices.
Furthermore, the new law would also give German officials powers akin to the "Hack Back" bill proposed in the US, allowing authorities the power to hack any remote computer. The Minister says this is important to "shut down private computers in the event of a crisis," such as is the case with botnet takedowns.
But privacy advocates who also read the new law proposal say the text also contains verbiage that would allow the German state to intercept any traffic on the Internet [1, 2], effectively setting up a surveillance state with full snooping powers over everyone's online communications. Experts called for caution before approving the new law, which could be abused in its current state.
German authorities anticipated such reaction and said that any access to such data would be allowed only after law enforcement have obtained a court order. But the problem with encryption backdoors is not how you access them, but that they exist in the first place and that they could be abused by ill-intent actors as well.
"
Yeah so if this passed it would be really bad for a few reasons: 1. It would be really bad for the privacy and security of German citizens because of the increased survalence and hacking mandated by the government. 2. It would be bad for everyone in the world because they could compel companies to put in backdoors which affect everyone. 3. Because it sets a precident that this is acceptable, which it absolutely is not.
So yeah, its bad.

"It's time to stop trusting Google search already"
Last weekend, in the hours after a deadly Texas church shooting, Google search promoted false reports about the suspect, suggesting that he was a radical communist affiliated with the antifa movement. The claims popped up in Google's "Popular on Twitter" module, which made them prominently visible - although not the top results - in a search for the alleged killer's name. Of course, the was just the latest instance of a long-standing problem: it was the latest of multiple similar missteps. As usual, Google promised to improve its search results, while the offending tweets disappeared. But telling Google to retrain its algorithms, as appropriate as that demand is, doesn't solve the bigger issue: the search engine's monopoly on truth.

The real lesson of that self-driving shuttle's first-day accident
The shuttle wasn't at fault, but it might have been able to avert the accident.
...
Wednesday was supposed to be the triumphant launch of a free, driverless shuttle in downtown Las Vegas. ... Instead, within hours, the project was greeted with the worst possible headline: "Self-driving shuttle bus in crash on first day."
The headline, and lots of others like it, were technically accurate but a little misleading. Officials say the other vehicle-a semi truck that bumped into the shuttle while backing up-was at fault. And it was such a low-speed collision that no one was injured. The accident "merely dented the plastic panels on the front of the shuttle," according to Jeff Zurschmeide of Digital Trends.
...
On the other side, the shuttle did exactly what it was programmed to do, and that's a critical point. The self-driving program didn't account for the vehicle in front unexpectedly backing up. We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked) and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss. The shuttle didn't have those responses in its program.
...
Either way, a clear lesson here is that self-driving vehicles need to be able to do more than just avoid causing accidents. They also need to be programmed to take the kind of common-sense steps human drivers would take to prevent accidents even when they're technically the fault of another driver.
"
While definitely not ready for mainstream adoption, as proven by this accident, self driving cars are a major innovation that has the potential to save lives. So I hope that this doesnt slow its adoption once the technology becomes ready to replace human drivers.

2. Equifax was solely at fault.
3. There are thousands of data brokers with similarly intimate information, similarly at risk.
4. These data brokers deliberately hide their actions, and make it difficult for consumers to learn about or control their data.
5. The existing regulatory structure is inadequate.
6. The market cannot fix this because we are not the customers of data brokers.
7. We need effective regulation of data brokers.
8. Resist complaints from the industry that this is "too hard."
9. This has foreign trade implications.
10. This has national security implications.
11. We need to do something about it.

A team of academics and private industry experts, led by DHS officials, remotely hacked a Boeing 757 airplane parked at an airport in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
The hack took place in September 2016 and was part of a controlled experiment. DHS owned the plane the hack was attempted on, and pilots had no knowledge that the research team was trying to break into the plane.
The DHS-led team said they didn't have physical access to interact with any system on the plane and all was done remotely via "radio frequency communications." The team needed only two days to come up with the hack and execute it.

We definitely need to consider the security implications of our infrastructure and transportation being so heavily connected. Hopefully the manufacturers will build products more securely before anyone gets hurt.

Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) wants the US to impose net neutrality rules on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, and other Web companies.
Net neutrality rules today apply only to Internet service providers, such as cable companies and mobile carriers. ISPs are not allowed to block, throttle, or demand payments to prioritize delivery of lawful Internet traffic. The rules are meant to give all websites-both the established players and startups-a fair shot at reaching Internet users.
But Franken argues that similar non-discrimination rules should apply to the most dominant websites.
"As tech giants become a new kind of Internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here: no one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't," Franken wrote yesterday in an op-ed for The Guardian. "Facebook, Google, and Amazon-like ISPs-should be 'neutral' in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms."

Im not sure how I feel about this. For ISPs its rather simple: I pay you for a, say for instance, 25 mbps connection to the internet. When I request information, I expect that the ISP will deliver it to me unaltered and at the speed I paid for, not at a slower speed, not with additional ads, and not blocked altogether. Both that statement and the implementation are straightforward.
How exactly net neutrality applies to google and facebook is unclear. What content should they be neutral with? How exactly should that be implemented? The article goes on to say that those details have not yet been thought about and that additional hearings will happen, so I will be following this closely.

WikiLeaks published the first-ever batch of source code for CIA cyber-weapons. The source code released today is for a toolkit named Hive, a so-called implant framework, a system that allows CIA operatives to control the malware it deploys on infected computers.
From March to August this year, WikiLeaks has released only documentation for supposed CIA cyber-weapons the organization claims were stolen from the CIA by hackers and insiders, and then handed over to its employees.
Those releases were part of a series of leaks WikiLeaks called Vault 7. Now, WikiLeaks says Hive is just the first of a long string of similar releases, a series WikiLeaks calls Vault 8, which will consist of source code for tools previously released in the Vault 7 series.
"
The existance of the code is not anything Id me concerned about.

DOJ: Strong encryption that we don't have access to is "unreasonable"
...
Poison the well
The DOJ's position runs counter to the consensus of information security experts, who say that it is impossible to build the strongest encryption system possible that would also allow the government access under certain conditions.
"Of course, criminals and terrorists have used, are using, and will use encryption to hide their planning from the authorities, just as they will use many aspects of society's capabilities and infrastructure: cars, restaurants, telecommunications," Bruce Schneier, a well-known cryptographer, wrote last year.
"In general, we recognize that such things can be used by both honest and dishonest people. Society thrives nonetheless because the honest so outnumber the dishonest. Compare this with the tactic of secretly poisoning all the food at a restaurant. Yes, we might get lucky and poison a terrorist before he strikes, but we'll harm all the innocent customers in the process. Weakening encryption for everyone is harmful in exactly the same way."
Rosenstein closed his interview by noting that he understands re-engineering encryption to accommodate government may make it weaker.
"And I think that's a legitimate issue that we can debate-how much risk are we willing to take in return for the reward?" he said.
"My point is simply that I think somebody needs to consider what's on the other side of the balance. There is a cost to having impregnable security, and we've talked about some of the aspects of that. The cost is that criminals are going to be able to get away with stuff, and that's going to prevent us in law enforcement from holding them accountable."
